# RileyLink Hardware

 * board.sch - circuit schematic
 * board.brd - pcb design file

### Components

The bom.csv file contains a list of parts and quantities

### PCB Assembly

You will have to look at the schematic and the board design in Kicad to know where the parts go, and how they are oriented.

I use a hot-air rework station to solder the BLE113 module, the CC1110 chip and the USB connector. The rest can be soldered with normal soldering station.
