# Loop2omnipod

A device that bridges the communication between Loop software application and Omnipon and Medtronics insulin pumps. This is a fork from RileyLink, focusing on reducing size of the device and improving communication range.

### Hardware

See the [hardware](https://github.com/skupas/rileylink/tree/master/hardware) directory for design files to build a RileyLink. The hardware design is released under [Creative Commons Share-alike 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).  

### Firmware

The code in the [firmware](https://github.com/skupas/rileylink/tree/master/firmware) directory runs on the RileyLink hardware.  There are two main chips on the RileyLink, and thus two firmware images.

### LED Lights

There are 3 leds on the back of the device: two red and one green. The green led blinks every 5 seconds while the module is connected over BLE and the battery in charged above 20%. The red leds indicate battery status: one will start blinking at 5 seconds interval once the battery drops below 20%, the other will turn solid red once you connect the charger. Once the battery is fully charged, both red leds should be off.
